# Experimental Node Graph
Was created as an experiment that was to prove that we could make our own node-graph solution. Other than the connections it works, although, after some gained experience it can certainly be improved.

## __Todo__
- [ ] Get lines to stay connected
- [ ] Pass data values through connections
- [ ] Build Compacters that will carry and mutate all values
- [ ] Build Extractors that will extract all values from Compacter
- [ ] Tie into System Dynamics basic calculations
- [ ] Add attributes on to connection for mutation by rate
- [ ] Ensure compatibility and performance remain key pieces
